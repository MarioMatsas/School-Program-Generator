# School-Program-Generator
This project shows how we could go about creating a program that generates school timetables.
It takes into account the fact that a teacher can't be teaching more than one class at a time and applies changes so that such a cenario is avoided.
Another important point is that this project only shows an example, of how such an idea could be implemented. Regardless of how many classes, teachers or subjects we add, the idea and way of going about solving this problem still stand firm, however i decided to use 3 classes and a handful of subjects, for the sake of simplicity.
